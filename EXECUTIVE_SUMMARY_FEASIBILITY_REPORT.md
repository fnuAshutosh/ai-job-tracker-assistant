## üéØ **NEXT STEPS RECOMMENDATION**

**Don't build everything at once.** Instead:

1. **Pick ONE high-impact feature** (I recommend Company Research Assistant)
2. **Build a working prototype** in 2-3 days
3. **Test with real users** (yourself and a few others)
4. **Measure usage and feedback**
5. **Then decide** what to build next based on actual user behavior

This approach minimizes risk while maximizing learning and impact.

**Bottom Line:** Your current tech stack can absolutely support building a comprehensive AI interview assistant. The question isn't "Can we build it?" but "What should we build first?" to deliver maximum value to users.
